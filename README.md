Cheetah Sound Recorder
=============

<p>A simple sound recording app expanded upon from Daniel Kim's sound recording application.</p>
This application allows for sound recordings to be created and stored on your phone. Files can be organized into categories using the tag system.
Files may also be uploaded to a firebase cloud storage. After files have been uploaded to cloud the user will recieve a shareable link to be able to access their recording on another device. Users also have the option to share recordings via QR codes with each recording having a unique qr code associated with it.

Created from Daniel Kim's sound recording application as a class project. The goal was to add sorting and cloud capabilities.
